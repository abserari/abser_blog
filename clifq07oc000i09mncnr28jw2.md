This section of writing, although called writing, should be considered as a thinking note.

Notes and writing are completely different. Writing always has a topic that describes the central point to the reader, while taking notes records information and thoughts, and for me, includes an evaluation. This evaluation is very useful when reviewing notes, as it can mark the thoughts at the time and compare them with the thoughts during the review, which can lead to a deeper understanding. When I review it, I find a small problem. There is a clear confirmation bias (a type of cognitive bias), which always assumes that the judgment at the time was correct and looks for favorable conditions to support it while ignoring unfavorable conditions.

Therefore, this essay should be seen more as notes on existing information, recorded in some knowledge base after the information is received, and the thinking done based on this information. Naturally, these notes will also be scattered and trivial during the overall organization.

After reading, it was found that the quality of writing as a project is indeed much higher. One point is to do the most important things first, establish the overall logic, and then polish it. This is all done to drive higher ROI under the premise that individual energy and resources are limited. However, in reality, individuals are easily immersed in the process, resulting in a lack of looking ahead. In this case, early design and planning are valuable. Although plans cannot always keep up with changes, having a plan first provides a clear path to follow, allowing more energy to be allocated to checking results during the process and feedback into the post-adjustment of the plan.

Naturally, limited energy is the most important factor, and maintaining information is not easy (given the information explosion), so the most valuable parts should be seized, and irrelevant effects should be selectively ignored. The problem with applying this principle is that people's cognitive judgments of things are different at different stages, and value judgments are fluctuating. This is also the importance of recording. Looking back, what was the reason for thinking at the time? What information was missing that led to erroneous judgments? What factors are currently causing differences from previous judgments? Is this factor invalid? If so, this information has interfered with the determination made at the time, and although it is feedback, it has not played a better iteration role.

Looking at the list of cognitive biases on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_cognitive\_biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases), it can be seen that people have too many cognitive biases, which are almost unavoidable. Everyone has times when their mind is unclear, and some people have long periods of it. However, cognition is not a skill that rapidly decays. Once practice stops, it will become redundant. Therefore, improving one's perspective will not disappear, at most it will be temporarily blinded, since in any new field, previous cognition may not work (or may even backfire).

In the end, it returns to the essence. After rationally abstracting and splitting the big system, and understanding the essence of the links and the different variations in the links, it seems that talking about abstractions leads to the same conclusion, such as the first principles. However, as the protagonist of one's own life, it is impossible to shield the details of one's life. Once focused on the details, one delves into the abstract level and discovers that focus makes a difference. Principles are only guiding, and there are still pits to step on in the details, but when you focus on these details, don't forget to look ahead.
