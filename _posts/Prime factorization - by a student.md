\## Question
Natural numbers greater than 1 must be showed that the result of the product of many prime integer.

\## Solution
By using natural interpretation, we can't solute this question easily.So we could try contradiction to solve it.

So we can assume that there are natural numbers greater than 1 that can not be written as the product of prime numbers.

About other number, we could devide them into two categories, prime and composite numbers.

First, we assume p is the prime number. The result of p = p is doesn't match assumption.

Second, we could use well-ordering theorem to prove that.

We make a set C that satisfies our assumption and well-ordering theorem. So there is a c that is a element in the C.

We could see that c = a \* b. In this case, a and b also is the natural numbers greater than 1 and less than c. So a, b is not belong to C.Both a and b could be write as the product of many prime. So c must be write as the product of many prime.

We could conclude that C is a empty set. So the result is alse doesn't match assumption.

In all, the assumption is not established.

Natural numbers greater than 1 must be showed that the result of the product of many prime integer.

\### Well Ordering Principle
Every \_nonempty \_set of \_nonnegative integers \_has a \_smallest \_element.
\> This statement is known as The \_Well Ordering Principle (WOP)\_.

it? Seems sort of obvious, right?

set—it’s false for the empty set which has \_no \_smallest element because it has no
elements at all.
\> And it requires a set of \*\*\_nonnegative\_\*\*\_ \_integers—it’s false for the
set of \_negative \_integers and also false for some sets of nonnegative \_rationals\_—for
example, the set of positive rationals.

\> So, the Well Ordering Principle captures
something special about the nonnegative integers.
