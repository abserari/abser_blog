\## Learn
This article will teach you more about the WOP(Well-Ordering Principle) and how to use it.

In addition, we will elaborate on the main points of this kind of problem.

\## Question
\*\*Theorem 1. \*\*\_There is no solution over the positive integers to the equation:
\_

\## Solution
This is an exercise, so you solve it.

\_Hint: \_

1\. Consider the minimum value of a among all possible solutions to ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/\_\_latex/9f7ea1371504290ac272ec5333d00df7.svg#card=math&code=4%20a%5E3%20%2B%202b%5E3%20%3D%20c%20%5E3&height=20&width=106).
1\. This argument is quite similar to the proof that ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/\_\_latex/e6f860efb95f26db5fd44c3e241c84c9.svg#card=math&code=%5Csqrt%202&height=21&width=22) is irrational.

\## Homework

1\. I put the actual solution in another Yuque document, you can guess where it is, or ask me after you've done it. It's link is \_https://yuque.com/abser/mathincs/is{guess what here is}\_.  The value of the {guess what here is}  is the number in the correct solution as a constant divisor.

2\. We've constructed the well-ordered set S with the values of a. can we use b and c.

3\. May you can prove ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/\_\_latex/e6f860efb95f26db5fd44c3e241c84c9.svg#card=math&code=%5Csqrt%202&height=21&width=22) is irrational again by using WOP.

4\. Can you change this problem? Change its coefficients, and then try to solve.
