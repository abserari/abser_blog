\## TL;DR;

\_acl\_ is a lightweight acl manager for \_go\_.

\## Features

\- Design simple & reusable roles to empower your application.
\- Acquire the rights of other roles to build a powerful set of permissions.
\- Resolve possible roles by examine them in an unified way.

\## Example

\`\`\`go
type User struct {
 isAdmin bool
}

func main() {
 // first of all: create a new manager instance to register all your roles in one place
 manager := acl.NewManager()

 // now you can use \`Ensure\` to guarantee that the role with the passed identifier is present
 user := manager.Ensure("user").Grant("profile.edit")
 // use \`Grant\`, \`Revoke\` and \`AcquireFrom\` to extend the right stack
 editor := manager.Ensure("editor").Grant("news.list", "news.create", "news.edit").AcquireFrom(user)

 // you can also use NewRole to create a Role manually
 admin := acl.NewRole("admin").Grant("news.delete").AcquireFrom(editor)
 // note, that you have to register the role by yourself
 manager.Register(admin)

 // to check if a right was granted to a role you can use:
 var hasAccess bool
 hasAccess = admin.Has("some.right")

 // to check if at least one of the expected rights is present:
 hasAccess = admin.HasOneOf("news.list", "news.create")

 // ... and finally, to check that all the expected rights are present, use:
 hasAccess = admin.HasAllOf("news.delete", "news.list")

 // a role can be extended with an examiner to determine whether a role can be added
 // to a \`ResultSet\`
 admin.SetExaminer(func (payload interface{}) bool {
 user := payload.(User)
 return user.isAdmin
 })

 // to get a result set you can use the managers \`Examine\` function
 rs := manager.Examine(User{isAdmin: true})

 // a result set contains "Has", "HasOneOf" and "HasAllOf" as described above and...
 // \`GetRole\` to grab specific roles from the result set
 expectedRole := rs.GetRole("admin")

 // you can also check if a role was added to a result set using:
 if rs.HasRole("admin") {
 // ...
 }
}
