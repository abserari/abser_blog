\## Question
\*\*Theorem 1.8.1\*\* ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/\_\_latex/e6f860efb95f26db5fd44c3e241c84c9.svg#card=math&code=%5Csqrt%202&height=21&width=22) is irrational.

\## Solution
\*\*\_Proof.\_\*\*\_ \_We use proof by contradiction.

Suppose the claim is false, and ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/\_\_latex/e6f860efb95f26db5fd44c3e241c84c9.svg#card=math&code=%5Csqrt%202&height=21&width=22) is rational. Then we can write![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/\_\_latex/e6f860efb95f26db5fd44c3e241c84c9.svg#card=math&code=%5Csqrt%202&height=21&width=22) as a fraction ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/\_\_latex/b26ffa0cc82660b8e5b4d4d5fd31db4b.svg#card=math&code=n%2Fd&height=20&width=27) in lowest terms.

Squaring both sides gives ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/\_\_latex/08e2a36523087394e58fc063923d6cf0.svg#card=math&code=2%20%3D%20n%5E2%20%2F%20d%5E2%20&height=23&width=73)  and so ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/\_\_latex/73c613eeebc17cadc1bbbb200bc5c1b1.svg#card=math&code=2d%5E2%20%3D%20n%20%5E2&height=19&width=65).

This implies that ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/\_\_latex/7b8b965ad4bca0e41ab51de7b31363a1.svg#card=math&code=n&height=12&width=10) is a multiple of 2.

why? could give proof? Hint: know that even equals 2p when p is integer.

Problem 1.15:

Let n be a nonnegative integer.

(a) Explain why if ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/\_\_latex/e937d5a502d6556c5c35bb8d5d61906d.svg#card=math&code=%5Ccolor%7Bblue%7D%7Bn%5E2%7D&height=19&width=17) is even—that is, a multiple of 2—then n is even.

(b) Explain why if ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/\_\_latex/e937d5a502d6556c5c35bb8d5d61906d.svg#card=math&code=%5Ccolor%7Bblue%7D%7Bn%5E2%7D&height=19&width=17) is a multiple of 3, then n must be a multiple of 3.

Problem 1.16:

Give an example of two distinct positive integers m; n such that ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/\_\_latex/e937d5a502d6556c5c35bb8d5d61906d.svg#card=math&code=%5Ccolor%7Bblue%7D%7Bn%5E2%7D&height=19&width=17) is a multiple of
m, but n is not a multiple of m. How about having m be less than n?

Therefore ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/\_\_latex/6595d679e306a127a3fe53268bcaddb2.svg#card=math&code=n%5E2&height=19&width=17) must be a multiple of 4.

But since ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/\_\_latex/73c613eeebc17cadc1bbbb200bc5c1b1.svg#card=math&code=2d%5E2%20%3D%20n%20%5E2&height=19&width=65), we know ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/\_\_latex/35fffee18cc777ec3b8cc7b401eb2377.svg#card=math&code=2d%5E2%20%0A&height=19&width=24) is a multiple of 4 and so ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/\_\_latex/826493fbe319671d8dd2aa6711227414.svg#card=math&code=d%5E2&height=19&width=16) is a multiple of 2.

This implies that d is a multiple of 2.

So, the numerator and denominator have 2 as a common factor, which contradicts
the fact that n=d is in lowest terms. Thus, 2 must be irrational.                                                                   ■

\## Homework
Anyway, you do not just write the answer of question, but write down everything all you can learn. For example, it's welcome for other concepts and other solution!  A question is totally great which modified base on these question so we can discuss more and learn deeply. If you think your comments so much, you could give us your Yuque document link.

1\. Solve upon questions, which color blue.
1\. Please use this method to prove that ![](https://cdn.nlark.com/yuque/\_\_latex/31298769fe250d8aa3c3437bc7db799a.svg#card=math&code=%5Csqrt%204&height=21&width=22) is irrational.
1\. How do we know this is always possible  that the fraction m/n can be written in lowest terms? Prove it. For example: 2/8 can be written in lowest terms as 1/4 when 1 and 4 are positive integers with no common prime factors. ( You could know it by using Well Ordering Principle.)

\## Concept

\### Proof by Contradiction
In a proof by contradiction, or indirect proof, you show that if a proposition were false, then some false fact would be true. Since a false fact by definition can’t be true, the proposition must be true.

Proof by contradiction is always a viable approach. However, as the name suggests, indirect proofs can be a little convoluted, so direct proofs are generally preferable when they are available.

Method: In order to prove a proposition P by contradiction:

1\. Write, “We use proof by contradiction.”

2\. Write, “Suppose P is false.”

3\. Deduce something known to be false (a logical contradiction).

4\.  Write, “This is a contradiction. Therefore, P must be true.”
